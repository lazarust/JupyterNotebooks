# News Text Summarization
This is the proof of concept notebook for the project stored in [this repository](https://github.com/lazarust/NewsTextSummarization).

## Proof of Concept
I completed the proof of concept in a Kaggle notebook that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thomaslazarus/summarization-comparison). I ran a article summarization using the T5, BERT, GPT, DistilBERT, GPT2, and Pegasus. I should probably look at a concrete way to define correct summarizations to better choose the model to use.
