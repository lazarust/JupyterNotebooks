# Jupyter Notebooks
This is a repository to hold all my Jupyter Notebook experiments and projects. Previously I made a new repository for each of the projects. Combining them all into one repository will help keep things orginized.

| Project | Description |
---------- | --------------
| [Book Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/lazarust/JupyterNotebooks/tree/main/BookRecommender) | Experiment for using the KNN algorithim to recommend books based off of liked books. |
| [Dog VS Cat Classifier](https://github.com/lazarust/JupyterNotebooks/tree/main/DogVsCatClassifier) | Familiarize myself with using Tensorflow for image classification. |
