# Jupyter Notebooks
This is a repository to hold all my Jupyter Notebook experiments and projects. Previously I made a new repository for each of the projects. Combining them all into one repository will help keep things orginized.

| Project | Description |
---------- | --------------
| [Book Recommendation Engine](./BookRecommender) | Experiment for using the KNN algorithm to recommend books based off of liked books. |
| [Dog VS Cat Classifier](./DogVsCatClassifier) | Familiarize myself with using Tensorflow for image classification. |
| [Goodreads Data Analysis](./Goodreads) | WIP Goodreads dataset analysis. |
| [Movie Genre Guesser](./MovieGenreClassifier) | The idea for this was to take different data for a movie and guessing a genre.|
