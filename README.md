# Jupyter Notebooks
This is a repository to hold all my Jupyter Notebook experiments and projects. Previously I made a new repository for each of the projects. Combining them all into one repository will help keep things orginized.

| Project | Description |
---------- | --------------
| [Book Recommendation Engine](./BookRecommender) | Experiment for using the KNN algorithm to recommend books based off of liked books. |
| [Dog VS Cat Classifier](./DogVsCatClassifier) | Familiarize myself with using Tensorflow for image classification. |
| [HuggingFace ðŸ¤— Course](./HuggingFaceCourse) | Notebook with code from the [HuggingFace Couse](https://huggingface.co/course). |
| [Kaggle Notebooks](./KaggleNotebooks) | This directory hold all the notebooks I've published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thomaslazarus). |
| [Movie Genre Guesser](./MovieGenreClassifier) | The idea for this was to take different data for a movie and guessing a genre.|
| [News Text Summarization](./NewsSummarization) | This is the proof of concept notebook for the project stored in [this repository](https://github.com/lazarust/NewsTextSummarization). |
| [Pokemon Statistics](./PokemonStatistics) | Familiarization of exploratory data analysis using some PokÃ©mon data. |
