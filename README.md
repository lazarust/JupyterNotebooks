# Jupyter Notebooks
This is a repository to hold all my Jupyter Notebook experiments and projects. Previously I made a new repository for each of the projects. Combining them all into one repository will help keep things orginized.

| Project | Description |
---------- | --------------
| [Book Recommendation Engine](./BookRecommender) | Experiment for using the KNN algorithim to recommend books based off of liked books. |
| [Dog VS Cat Classifier](./DogVsCatClassifier) | Familiarize myself with using Tensorflow for image classification. |
| [News Text Summarization](./NewsSummarization) | This is the proof of concept notebook for the project stored in [this repository](https://github.com/lazarust/NewsTextSummarization). |
