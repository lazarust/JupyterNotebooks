# HuggingFace ü§ó Course

__Course:__ [HuggingFace Couse](https://huggingface.co/course)

I've been wanting to work on this course for a while now and I finally had some free time this past weekend to finish the rest of it. The course as a whole was really enjoyable! Checkout the code in the notebook to see some of the things I expermiented with. A lot of the code is straight from the course with some minor changes as I changed different settings to see what would happen.

It definitely helped combine my knowledge from random articles I read while working on my undergraduate capstone project. In that project, I worked on summarizing news articles and displaying them simply, but I hadn't thought at all about fine-tuning the tokenizer or even the model much! This course has truly helped me brush up on some of the basic concepts and has helped me think of new ways to go back and tackle that project! I really look forward to revisiting that project whenever I get some time (hopefully that will be soon ü§ûüèΩ)!
