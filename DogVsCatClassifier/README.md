The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with Tensorflow for image classification. Also switched from running the python
from a python file to a jupyter notebook.

The figure below shows the distribution of images with 1 being cat and 0 being dog.

The accuracy after running the model for 30 epochs was around 82%

When running this model on a final generated test set 8 out of 10 of the returned values was correct which is expected given the accuracy.
